To run ms2query, ms2deepscore, and spec2vec from with the specXplore importing pipeline, model and library files are required. However, the model files are too large to be hosted on github. Pre-trained models and curated library files are available via ms2query for both [positive](https://zenodo.org/records/10527997) and [negative](https://zenodo.org/records/10528030) mode data (links updated Jan 26, 2024). Model and library files for positive or negative mode should be put into separate folders. The importing pipeline requires the appropriate directory paths to these model folders to function.
