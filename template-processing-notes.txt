Template code structure for the pre-processing steps to be done by the end user.


- for spectral similarity scoring only the ms2query folder location is needed in the current implementation. models are automatically fetched.
- ms2query's currently used implementation can only do batch folder runs. If the single file run is available, the input-filename.mgf can be used for both ms2query and the matchms mgf importer. For now, the >> assumed << single mgf file input name is needed separately from the folder name.

- mds2query provides some convenience with folder based batch processing. My preferred approach for this is different however. I'd like to have a batch processing tool which can merge mutliple mgf files into one, but then processing is kept to a single linear input -> output chain whithout different numbers of intermediates. I process the standards differently from the experimental mgf file since the annotation approach differs.

matchms notes
- save_as_mgf does not overwrite an existing mgf; instead it starts to add to it! There is no mention of this anywhere of course.

ms2query notes:
- the ms2query models and library folder will contain the models for pairwise similarity matrix computation
- however, they will be multiple files, with complex names, including post vs neg differentiation.
- ms2query files need to be downloaded to two separate folders for positive and negative modes
- note also that ms2query seems to produce a different results.csv for negative mode than for positvie mode (neg has no classificaiton); using the classification table from positive mode seems to work however
- The version of ms2query currently used does not have support for single input file runs using run_ms2query_single_file (not defined)
- the zenodo downloader avoids downloading if files are already present. Assessment of filenames is done using the zenodo directory provided and the various filenames contained within the folder.
- ms2query filenames are long, timestamped and quite inconsistent. Writing generic find and load model files may be tricky. ms2ds and spec2vec / s2v occur in names. In general, in the ion mode specific folder, one .hdf5 file for ms2deepscore needs to be loaded. In addition, a .model, a .model.syn1neg.npy, and a model.wv.vectors.npy need to be loaded. On the basis of file type suffixes alone the corresponding files could thus be identified and loaded. In addition, spec2vec loading only requires the .model path, the rest is dealt with automatically. Hence, in each model case, only one file needs to be found. 
- ms2query produces a result csv file for each spectrums.mgf file in the input file location. It inherits the name of the input.mgf file, with .mgf being turned into .csv. 
- Filenames for standards and experimental spectra should be different to avoid filename overlap problems from ms2query's folder processing approach


- ms2query will refuse to give any results for some spetra that fail to pass some cleaning criteria. Those spectra will be omitted from the results.csv file. However, the ms2query query_spectrum_nr will be based on the iloc + 1 of the spectra in the original list. This means that it is in principle possible to expand the reduced size ms2query output to full size with NA.
